module Puppet::Pops
# Module for making a call such that there is an identifiable entry on
# the ruby call stack enabling getting a puppet call stack
# To use this make a call with:
# ```
# Puppet::Pops::PuppetStack.stack(file, line, receiver, message, args)
# ```
# To get the stack call:
# ```
# Puppet::Pops::PuppetStack.stacktrace
#
# When getting a backtrace in Ruby, the puppet stack frames are
# identified as coming from "in 'stack'" and having a ".pp" file
# name.
# To support testing, a given file that is an empty string, or nil
# as well as a nil line number are supported. Such stack frames
# will be represented with the text `unknown` and `0Â´ respectively.
#
module PuppetStack
  # Sends a message to an obj such that it appears to come from
  # file, line when calling stacktrace.
  #
  def self.stack(file, line, obj, message, args, &block)

    line = 0 if line.nil?

      Kernel.eval("obj.send(message, *args, &block)", Kernel.binding(), file, line)

    end
