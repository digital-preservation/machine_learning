tag 'audit:medium',

#
# This test is intended to ensure that pluginsync syncs feature definitions to
# the agents.  It checks the feature twice; once to make sure that it gets
# loaded successfully during the run in which it was synced, and once to ensure
# that it still gets loaded successfully during the subsequent run (in which it
# should not be synced because the files haven't changed.)
