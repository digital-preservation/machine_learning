  tag 'audit:low',          # cli/ca behavior for non-standard workflows
      'audit:integration',
      'server'              # Ruby CA is deprecated

  # This acceptance test documents the behavior of `puppet cert generate` calls
  # for three cases:
  #
  # 1) On a host which has ssl/ca infrastructure.  Typically this would be the
  # puppet master which is also the CA, and the expectation is that this is the
  # host that `puppet cert generate` commands should be issued on.
  #
  # This case should succeed as it is the documented use case for the command.
  #
  # 2) On a host which has no ssl/ca infrastructure but has a valid ca.pem from
  # the CA cached in ssl/cert.  This would be a host (let's say CN=foo) with a
  # puppet agent that has checked in and received a signed ca.pem and foo.pem
  # certificate from the master CA.
  #
  # Talking with Nick Fagerlund, this behavior is unspecified, although it
  # should not result in a certificate.  And it currently fails with "Error:
  # The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent's
  # private key."  This error messaging is a little misleading, in that it is
  # strictly speaking true but does not point out that it is the CA cert and
  # local CA keys that are involved.
  #
  # What happens is `puppet cert generate` starts by creating a local
  # CertificateAuthority instance which looks for a locally cached
  # ssl/cert/ca.pem, generating ssl/ca/ keys in the process.  It finds an
  # ssl/cert/ca.pem, because we have the master CA's pem, but this certificate
  # does not match the keys in ssl/ca that have just been generated (for the
  # local CA instance), and validation of the cert fails with the above error.
  #
  # 3) On a host which has no ssl infrastructure at all (fresh install, hasn't
  # tried to send a CSR to the puppet master yet).
  #
  # Tracing this case, what happens is that `puppet cert generate` starts by
  # creating a local CertificateAuthority instance which looks for a locally
  # cached ssl/cert/ca.pem.  It does not find one and then procedes to
  # generate_ca_certificate, which populates a local ssl/ca with public/private
  # keys for a local ca cert, creates a CSR locally for this cert, which it
  # then signs and saves in ssl/ca/ca_crt.pem and caches in ssl/certs/ca.pem.
  # (This is the normal bootstrapping case for a CA; same thing happens during an
  # initial `puppet master` run).
  #
  # This case succeeds, but future calls such as `puppet agent -t` fail.
  # Haven't fully traced what happens here.
